# ffuf API Testing Requirements

## Project Goals

1. Transform ffuf into a specialized API testing and discovery tool
2. Maintain the high performance and efficiency that ffuf is known for
3. Add comprehensive API-specific features while keeping the core simple
4. Integrate with the api_wordlist repository for improved endpoint discovery
5. Provide best-in-class tools for API security testing and bug bounty hunting

## Technical Requirements

### Core Functionality

- Must maintain all existing ffuf fuzzing capabilities
- Should add dedicated API testing mode with specialized options
- Must support REST, GraphQL, and other common API formats
- Should efficiently process large API wordlists
- Must handle complex authentication flows for APIs

### Performance Requirements

- API testing features should not significantly impact performance
- Should optimize memory usage when processing large API responses
- Must maintain high concurrency for API endpoint discovery
- Should intelligently handle rate limiting from API endpoints

### User Experience

- API-specific output should be clear and easy to interpret
- Should provide visualization options for API mapping
- Must have comprehensive documentation for API testing features
- Should offer intelligent filtering options for API responses

### Integration Requirements

- Must integrate with api_wordlist repository data
  - Should import and utilize all endpoint patterns from the api_wordlist repository
  - Must categorize endpoints according to api_wordlist classification system
  - Should maintain compatibility with api_wordlist format updates
  - Must enable efficient searching and filtering of the api_wordlist collection
- Should support import/export with other API testing tools
- Must provide programmatic access to API testing results
- Should integrate with common authentication providers

## Constraints

- Must maintain backward compatibility with existing ffuf commands
- Should not introduce dependencies that would complicate deployment
- Must work across platforms (Linux, macOS, Windows)
- Should maintain Go as the implementation language
- Must follow Go best practices and code organization

## Success Criteria

1. Successful identification of API endpoints that other tools miss
2. Faster and more efficient API testing compared to alternatives
3. Positive feedback from the bug bounty and security testing community
4. Increased adoption for API-specific testing use cases
5. Comprehensive documentation that enables effective API testing
